This dissertation consisted of the study of solvation free energy calculations of aromatic solutes that can mimic asphaltenes in different solvents with the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie coarse-grained force field. Solvation free energy studies are mostly done using water as a solvent and with all-atom force fields based on the Lennard-Jones Potential, therefore, with this study, we provided data that were lacking in the literature. Additionally, the free energy estimations done can help improve the SAFT-$\gamma$  Mie force field since these calculations are helpful in identifying errors in the modeling process. The SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie uses the SAFT-VR Mie EoS in its parameterization, which results in a more straightforward method of obtaining parameters. Following this strategy, the phenanthrene parameters, which were not available in this force field database, were obtained using phase equilibrium data and two different ring equations and geometries. However, only the parameters estimated with the ring equation proposed by \citeonline{muller2017} were utilized in the solvation free energy simulations since this equation did not have inconsistencies in its parameterization.

To obtain accurate solvation free energies, we carefully selected and optimized the coupling parameter and their respective simulation weights used in our Expanded Ensemble simulations. The resulting potential energies from these simulations were then served as input to estimate solvation free energy differences with the MBAR method. The results for solvation free energy differences with non-aqueous solvents had absolute deviations to the experimental
data of less than 2.0 kcal/mol, except for the pair 1-octanol+anthracene. We also observed the geometry effect on the free energy curves - larger molecules had steeper curves and more substantial absolute deviations. The influence of carbon dioxide on the solvation free energy of phenanthrene in toluene was found to be minimum. The $\Delta G_{solv}$ decreased slightly until the mass fraction of $CO_{2}$ was equal to 0.119 and, after this point, solvation free energies increased. 

Hydration free energy differences calculations with the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie model required the use of relatively larger values of $k_{ij}$ to obtain satisfactory results. We chose to estimate the parameter with the output from molecular dynamics data since the strategy of using the SAFT-VR Mie EoS did not provide good results. This necessity of one additional parameter happens probably due to the lack of a term to account for the hydrogen bond on the EoS that the model is based and due to the problems associated with the coarse-graining of water molecules. The results with $k_{ij}$ estimated with MD output were great, the absolute deviations to the experimental data found were smaller than the ones for the GAFF and ELBA force field. We also used the solvation free energies to calculate partition coefficients in water/1-octanol, water/hexane, and toluene/hexane. The absolute deviations to the experimental data obtained were similar to the ones found for all-atom force fields (Gromos, TraPPE and OPLS-AA/TraPPE) and other coarse-grained force filed (ELBA).

Overall, the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field proved to be an excellent model to represent the solvation phenomenon. It correctly described solvation free energy differences of solutes mimicking asphaltenes in hexane, toluene, 1-octanol, and water. The requirement of binary interaction parameter estimated with MD output for hydration free energies increases the simulation time, which is already more significant for this water model due to its coarse-graining level. Nevertheless, the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field for water used does not predict freezing at room temperature as other force fields, which is essential for our hydration free energy calculations. Based on this work, we have some ideas for future development. We intend to test the binary interaction parameter representability to calculations with other aromatic solutes in water. Additionally, we want to use the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field to model more complex asphaltenes models and, consequently, increase the scale of the simulations we performed. The final step to expand this work would be to develop new methodologies to use solvation free energies to calculate solubility efficiently.
